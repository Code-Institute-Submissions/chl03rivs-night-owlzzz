# Night Owlzzz

[View live project here on GitHub Pages]()

Night Owlzzz is a late-night café-bar in Cork for those looking to escape the drink culture of the city without giving up on having a fun night out. Visitors can play board games, read, or simply hang out until the late hours while sipping on hot drinks, mocktails or eating healthy snacks and sandwiches. 

The website will be targeted to new and returning customers alike. Night Owlzz will be useful for customers looking to book a table/room in advance and prepare for their visit (by browsing the list of games, food, etc.).

### Future features
----

* *Blog section* - to provide users with game tutorials and reviews for an enhanced in-person experience. 
    * I believe that this would be a helpful feature to have on the website as it would help visitors decide what game they would like to play before their visit. 
    * It would also make it easier for party members that are new to board games to learn ahead of time and enjoy their visit more.
* *Form confirmation page* - to provide users with a confirmation message post form submission.
